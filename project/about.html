        <p>
            In May of 2016, I graduated from the University of Colorado of Boulder with a Bachelor's of Science specializing in Finance
            and Information Management from the Leed's School of Business. At the time I was super skeptical of the degree
            I chose. I had participated in a few internships in previous summers, not really enjoying the work or the "9-5"
            style of work in a cubicle.
        </p>
        <p>So, I took my talents to the service industry. I worked at Pizzeria Locale in Boulder, an upscale Neapolitan pizza
            restaurant that served expensive wine and probably too expensive pizza. It is delicious though, I'll give 'em
            that. I worked here for about 18 months, acting like an experienced server by the end of it and acting like I
            knew all about wine. In any case, the job allowed me to save a boat-load of money while paying cheap rent. So,
            eventually, I decided I needed to get out of the country for a while. For the next six months I traveled through
            New Zealand, Australia, and Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>
            These six months were life changing and amazing. I miss it everyday. There were two huge things I learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We must care for this Earth. Many of the places I went to (especially in lesser developed Indonesia) were unbelievably
                littered and trashed. We must pick up our trash and reduce waste. I also learned about growing food and the
                importance of this, along with the importance of moving away from a meat based diet. Plants Rule!!
            </li>
            <li>I want to be a coder! I had heard about the Galvanize program before I left and it always sounded intriguing.
                I realized this benefit of seeing and experiencing the world, and I think that being a coder could facilitate
                this quite well. I want to work towards working remotely and being able to work from anywhere around the
                world!
